This file will just contain some short notes about things to fix or
features that could be implemented.

== Count votes per person ==

* Testcase: - Run on old log and make sure all detected votes can be
assigned to one single author - Look in old logs for duplicate votes
  
* Implementation: - Look for the next signature following a vote. This
can also be used to raise a warning about unsigned votes.  - Should
also look whether a vote comes from a logged in account.
